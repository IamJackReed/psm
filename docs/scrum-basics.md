## Scrum Definition & Theory

Scrum is a **lightweight** framework that helps people, teams and organisations **generate value** by creating **adaptive solutions** for **complex** problems.

In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:

1. A Product Owner **orders the work** for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
2. The Scrum Team **turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value** during a Sprint.
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders **inspect the results and adjust** for the next Sprint.
4. Repeat

The Scrum framework is **purposefully incomplete**, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory. Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.

Various processes, techniques and methods can be employed within the framework. Scrum wraps around existing practices or renders them unnecessary. Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of current management, environment, and work techniques, so that **improvements can be made**.

Each element of the framework **serves a specific purpose that is essential** to the overall value and results realised with Scrum.

While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum. **Scrum exists only in its entirety** and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices.

> Example 1: A Scrum Team cannot decide that the Sprint Retrospective would not be needed.

> Example 2: Developers cannot choose that to skip the Daily Scrum because they might be busy with writing code or developing the product.

Scrum is founded on:
**Empiricism and lean thinking**. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from **experience** and **making decisions based on what is observed**. Lean thinking **reduces waste** and **focuses on the essentials**.

Scrum is:

1. **Not a process, technique, or definitive method**.
2. **A framework** within which can employ various processes and techniques.
3. Employs an **iterative, incremental approach** to optimise predictability and to control risk.
4. Lightweight.
5. Simple to understand.
