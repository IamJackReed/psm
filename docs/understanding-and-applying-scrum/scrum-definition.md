# Scrum Definition

The Scrum framework is **purposefully incomplete**, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory.

Scrum is a **lightweight** framework that helps people, teams and organisations **generate value** through **adaptive solutions** for **complex problems**.

Scrum **wraps around existing practices** or renders them unnecessary. Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of current management, environment, and work techniques, **so that improvements can be made**.

The Scrum framework consists of:
- Scrum Teams
- Roles / Accountabilities
- Events
- Rules
- Artifacts

Each element of the framework serves a specific purpose that is essential to the overall value and results realised with Scrum. Changing the core design or ideas of Scrum, leaving out elements, or not following the rules of Scrum, covers up problems and limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless.

In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:

- A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.

- The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.

- The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.

- Repeat

Scrum is simple. Try it as is and determine if its philosophy, theory, and structure help to achieve goals and create value.

Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.

Various processes, techniques and methods can be employed within the framework.

Scrum guide recommends **using all the Scrum components and rules (not just the ones which suit). While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum.

- **Example 1:** _Scrum Team cannot decide that the Sprint Retrospective isn't needed._
- **Example 2:** _Developers cannot choose to skip the Daily Scrum event because they are busy writing code or developing the Product._

Scrum is:
- **Not a process, technique, or definitive method**
- **A framework** within which can employ various processes and techniques.
- Employs an **iterative, incremental approach to optimise predictability and to control risk.**
- lightweight.
- Simple to understand.
