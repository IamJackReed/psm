### Scrum Guide
Scrum Guide - 2020
{: .label .label-green }

- Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage.
- The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other.
- Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals.
- The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges.
- Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work.
- The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.
- These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior.
- The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not diminish or undermine them.
- The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts.
- When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.
- These [Artifact] commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.

**Lack of trust impacts all of the above Values.**

The Scrum framework can seem mechanical on its own. Many Scrum teams treat the roles, artifacts, and events as items to check off of a list during a Sprint, rather than as powerful tools for delivering products. This lack of life in the framework in and in response to the need for a supporting a culture that would enable Scrum to be successful was likely why, in 2017, the Scrum founders added the Scrum values to The Scrum Guide.

The Scrum Values describe five simple ideas that when practiced encourage an agile culture. The Scrum values describe behaviors that both Scrum Teams and the organisations they work within should exhibit.

When talking about an agile mindset, that includes the Scrum
values, the values and principles from the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, and Lean Principles.4 These values and principles guide the decisions that a Scrum Team makes, and they directly affect the effectiveness of that team in collaborating while using an empirical process to deliver valuable Product Increments.

üí° Coaching
{: .label .label-blue }
**Commitment** - Scrum isn‚Äôt meant to be easy. It is designed to provoke change and change can push people outside their comfort zones. If you are starting with a new team observe whether they are living and breathing the Scrum Values. For example, when observing a Scrum Team in terms of commitment:

- [ ] Are they committed to the team‚Äôs goals or their own personal goals?
- [ ] Are they willing to collaborate and find solutions when things go wrong or do they throw their hands in the air and give up?
- [ ] Are they willing to try something else?
- [ ] Are they willing to volunteer for tasks they don‚Äôt particularly enjoy or that aren‚Äôt in their core skillset if it‚Äôs in the best interests of the team?

**Focus** -
- [ ] Are the Scrum Team focussed on the Sprint Goal and able to stay focussed when distractions inevitably arise?
