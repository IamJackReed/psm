## Scrum Values

Scrum Guide - 2020
{: .label .label-green }

- Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage.
- The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other.
- Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals.
- The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges.
- Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work.
- The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.
- These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behaviour.
- The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not diminish or undermine them.
- The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts.
- When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.
- These [Artifact] commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.

**Lack of trust impacts all of the above Values.**

These values relate to the ethics of Scrum, thereby from a social point of view turning Scrum into a value system.

The Scrum framework can seem mechanical on its own. Many Scrum teams treat the roles, artifacts, and events as items to check off of a list during a Sprint, rather than as powerful tools for delivering products. This lack of life in the framework and in response to the need for a supporting a culture that would enable Scrum to be successful was likely why, in **2017, the Scrum founders added the Scrum values to The Scrum Guide**.

The Scrum Values describe five simple ideas that when practiced **encourage an agile culture**. The Scrum values describe behaviours that both Scrum Teams and the organisations they work within should exhibit.

When talking about an agile mindset, that includes the **Scrum
values**, the values and principles from the **Manifesto for Agile Software Development**, and **Lean Principles**. These values and principles guide the decisions that a Scrum Team makes, and they directly affect the effectiveness of that team in collaborating while using an empirical process to deliver valuable Product Increments.

Software development is complex and so are people. When things are going well, the complexity seems manageable. But when stuff starts hitting the fan, bad things can and do happen. These difficult moments are why we need the Scrum values.

Understanding the Scrum values can lead to **better decisions**, **higher-quality work**, and a **truly collaborative environment**.

These values are critical to understanding the "WHY" of Scrum. They act as guideposts when your team gets lost. More importantly, they drive the decisions that impact your daily work. Failing to understand them prevents your team from improving their ability to deliver value.

The Scrum values can guide you through the many obstacles and difficult situations that inevitably arise during software development projects. Without these values, practices rote and collaboration feels forced and mechanical.

## ü§ù Commitment

Scrum Guide - 2020
{: .label .label-green }

- Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage.
- The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other.- Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
- Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured.
- [Artifact commitment:] For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.
- [Artifact commitment:] For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.
- [Artifact commitment:] For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.
- Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it.

Insights
{: .label .label-yellow }

**People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.**

**Commitment** - means the Scrum Team members should commit to bringing their best efforts forward and helping each other succeed.

**Commitment** - means the Scrum Team members should personally commit to achieving the Scrum Goals. Commitment is about **dedication and applies to the actions, the effort, not the final results.**

**Commitment** - is vital because it can transform a team. It‚Äôs a promise to yourself, your teammates, and your organisation to do the very best work you can. If everyone on your Scrum team is committed to delivering a done increment of valuable product each and every sprint, you can accomplish great things together.

In a Scrum context the decisions we take, the steps we take, the way we play Scrum, the practices we add to Scrum, the activities we surround Scrum with should re-enforce these values, not diminish or undermine them:

- Commit to the team.
- Commit to quality.
- Commit to collaborate.
- Commit to learn. Commit to do the best we can, every day again.
- Commit to the Sprint Goal.
- Commit to be professional.
- Commit to self-organise.
- Commit to excellence.
- Commit to the agile principles. Commit to create working software.
- Commit to look for improvements.
- Commit to the Definition of Done.
- Commit to the Scrum framework.
- Commit to focus on Value.
- Commit to finish work.
- Commit to inspect & adapt. Commit to transparency.
- Commit to challenge the status-quo.

## üéØ Focus

Scrum Guide - 2020
{: .label .label-green }

- [The Scrum Team] is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.
- If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganising into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product.
- Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team‚Äôs focus and consistency.
- The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done.
- The Sprint Goal also creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives
- Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team‚Äôs focus and consistency.
- The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self- management.
- Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured.
- Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals.
- The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done.

**Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and goals of the Scrum team.**

- **Focus** - means everyone should be focused on the sprint goal and the desired outcome of the sprint. The product owner must be focused on value, while the development team should focus on delivery and quality under the watchful eye of the Scrum master, who‚Äôs focused on the team‚Äôs use of Scrum and on removing any impediment that blocks them from delivering the increment.

üí° Coaching
{: .label .label-blue }

**Commitment** - Scrum isn‚Äôt meant to be easy. It is designed to provoke change and change can push people outside their comfort zones. If you are starting with a new team observe whether they are living and breathing the Scrum Values. For example, when observing a Scrum Team in terms of commitment:

- [ ] Are they committed to the team‚Äôs goals or their own personal goals?
- [ ] Are they willing to collaborate and find solutions when things go wrong or do they throw their hands in the air and give up?
- [ ] Are they willing to try something else?
- [ ] Are they willing to volunteer for tasks they don‚Äôt particularly enjoy or that aren‚Äôt in their core skillset if it‚Äôs in the best interests of the team?

**Focus** -
- [ ] Are the Scrum Team focussed on the Sprint Goal and able to stay focussed when distractions inevitably arise?
