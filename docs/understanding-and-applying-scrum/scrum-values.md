### Scrum Guide
Scrum Guide - 2020
{: .label .label-green }

- Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage.
- The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other.
- Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals.
- The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges.
- Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work.
- The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.
- These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior.
- The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not diminish or undermine them.
- The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts.
- When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.
- These [Artifact] commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.

**Lack of trust impacts all of the above Values.**

The Scrum framework can seem mechanical on its own. Many Scrum teams treat the roles, artifacts, and events as items to check off of a list during a Sprint, rather than as powerful tools for delivering products. This lack of life in the framework in and in response to the need for a supporting a culture that would enable Scrum to be successful was likely why, in 2017, the Scrum founders added the Scrum values to The Scrum Guide.

The Scrum Values describe five simple ideas that when practiced encourage an agile culture. The Scrum values describe behaviors that both Scrum Teams and the organisations they work within should exhibit.

When talking about an agile mindset, that includes the Scrum
values, the values and principles from the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, and Lean Principles.4 These values and principles guide the decisions that a Scrum Team makes, and they directly affect the effectiveness of that team in collaborating while using an empirical process to deliver valuable Product Increments.

### 🤝 Commitment

Commitment / Scrum Guide - 2020
{: .label .label-green }

- The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other.
- Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
- Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured.
- [Artifact commitment:] For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.
- [Artifact commitment:] For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.
- [Artifact commitment:] For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.
- Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it.

Commitment / Insights
{: .label .label-yellow }

**People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.**

- **Commitment** - means eople should commit to bringing their best efforts forward and helping each other succeed.

**Commitment:** - means the Scrum Team members should personally commit to achieving the Scrum Goals. Commitment is about **dedication and applies to the actions, the effort, not the final results.** The Scrum should commit to:

- Quality, commit to collaborate.
- Learn, commit to do the best they can, every day.
- Being professional.
- Self-manage, commit to excellence.
- Agile principles, commit to create working software.
- Look for improvements, commit to the Definition of Done.
- Scrum framework, commit to focus on value.
- Finish work, commit to inspecting & adapting.
- Maintain transparency.
- Delivering high-quality products.
- Meeting the Sprint Goal (instead of the exact amount of product backlog items.
- Delivering working, usable software that meets the expectations of the customers and users.
- Working only on the product backlog items with the highest value.
- Focus on continuous improvement, technical excellence.
- Truly collaborate with all the business people involved.

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage.

#### The Misuse of Commitment

> Commitment might be the most abused term in Scrum. It's related to the famous saying "we ask them for estimates and then treat them as deadlines". In organisations starting with Scrum, some old school (project) managers fear the seeming lack of grip that comes along with it. But luckily the Scrum Guide offered them 'commitment'. Development teams should commit themselves upfront to sprint results. No matter how complex (and by this unpredictable) the software, a hard commitment by the development team is a precondition. Should any unforeseen problems arise, then that's the problem of the development team, they gave their commitment, so they should fix it, just order some pizza and carry on!
>
>To me, commitment in this context smells. Therefore I prefer using the term 'forecast'. When planning a sprint, the team gives a forecast of the amount of functionality they think they can deliver, given the available knowledge. But taking into account the complexity of software development, giving 100% guarantees and impossible and meaningless. I rather trust teams they will do everything that's possible to deliver a valuable, high-quality product.
>
>Fortunately, in the latest Scrum Guide commitment was actually replaced by forecast. I can only warmly welcome this.

#### What Commitment is About?

>The discussion I've had basically boils down to: if I can't ask a commitment of the development team, how will I know they will actually deliver the discussed scope of the sprint? The short answer is: you don't. People can get ill, new insights on a technical approach might occur or some upfront dependencies turn out to be real impediments.
>
>The misunderstanding is the perception that by changing commitment in the forecast, the development team doesn't have to commit to anything anymore. But the only thing that changed is the development team now gives a forecast of the specific product backlog items they think can be completed in a sprint, this instead of giving a commitment to the exact scope.
>
>However, the development team still does commit to:
>
>Delivering high-quality products. The team commits to doing their best to achieve the goal while maintaining high quality.
Meeting the sprint goal (instead of the exact amount of product backlog items)
Delivering working, usable software that meets the expectations of the customers and users
Working only on the product backlog items with the highest value
Focus on continuous improvement, technical excellence
Truly collaborate with all the business people involved
And for sure, I prefer a development team that commits to all the above points, then a team that drops quality and takes some ugly shortcuts only to "satisfy" the stakeholders with a "done" sprint. When this is a reality, you've got a lot of smells in place that need attention

#### Commitment facilitates empiricism and collaborative teamwork.

> When we **commit to the success of the team**, not just caring about our individual achievements, that creates an environment of trust, productive problem solving, and high team standards.
>  
> When we **commit to doing Scrum fully**, not just picking and choosing the easy parts, we can fully experience the benefits of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
>  
> Committing to continuous improvement makes it **easier to change direction** based on new information or empirical data.
>  
> **Commitment is about dedication to doing our best**.  We cannot predict or control all of the complexities in product development, but we can commit to taking action and adjusting our behaviours based on feedback and new learnings.
>  
> When we **commit to delivering value**, we feel a greater sense of shared purpose that drives our motivation to collaborate.

### 🎯 Focus

**Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and goals of the Scrum team.**

- **Focus** - means everyone should be focused on the sprint goal and the desired outcome of the sprint. The product owner must be focused on value, while the development team should focus on delivery and quality under the watchful eye of the Scrum master, who’s focused on the team’s use of Scrum and on removing any impediment that blocks them from delivering the increment.

---

### 🦁 Courage

**Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.**

- **Courage** - means the Scrum team should have the courage needed to work transparently, to do the right thing—even when it’s painful—and to tackle difficult challenges.

---

### ❤️ Respect

**Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.**

- **Respect** - means the Scrum team members need to show respect for one another and for everyone outside the team, seeing them as capable, intelligent, and creative problem solvers who are each doing the best work they can.

---

### 🚪 Openness

**Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about the all the work and the challenges with performing the work.**

💡 Coaching
{: .label .label-blue }
**Commitment** - Scrum isn’t meant to be easy. It is designed to provoke change and change can push people outside their comfort zones. If you are starting with a new team observe whether they are living and breathing the Scrum Values. For example, when observing a Scrum Team in terms of commitment:

- [ ] Are they committed to the team’s goals or their own personal goals?
- [ ] Are they willing to collaborate and find solutions when things go wrong or do they throw their hands in the air and give up?
- [ ] Are they willing to try something else?
- [ ] Are they willing to volunteer for tasks they don’t particularly enjoy or that aren’t in their core skillset if it’s in the best interests of the team?

**Focus** -
- [ ] Are the Scrum Team focussed on the Sprint Goal and able to stay focussed when distractions inevitably arise?
