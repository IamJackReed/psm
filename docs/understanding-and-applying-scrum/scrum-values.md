## Scrum Values

Scrum Guide - 2020
{: .label .label-green }

- Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage.
- The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other.
- Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals.
- The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges.
- Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work.
- The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.
- These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behaviour.
- The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not diminish or undermine them.
- The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts.
- When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.
- These [Artifact] commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.

## ü§ù Commitment

Scrum Guide - 2020
{: .label .label-green }

- Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage.
- The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other.
- Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
- Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured.
- [Artifact commitment:] For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.
- [Artifact commitment:] For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.
- [Artifact commitment:] For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.
- Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it.

## üéØ Focus

Scrum Guide - 2020
{: .label .label-green }

- [The Scrum Team] is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.
- If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganising into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product.
- Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team‚Äôs focus and consistency.
- The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done.
- The Sprint Goal also creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives
- Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team‚Äôs focus and consistency.
- The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self- management.
- Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured.
- Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals.
- The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done.

Insights
{: .label .label-yellow }

The Scrum framework can seem mechanical on its own. Many Scrum teams treat the roles, artifacts, and events as items to check off of a list during a Sprint, rather than as powerful tools for delivering products. This lack of life in the framework and in response to the need for a supporting a culture that would enable Scrum to be successful was likely why, in **2017, the Scrum founders added the Scrum values to The Scrum Guide**.

The Scrum Values describe five simple ideas that when practiced **encourage an agile culture**. The Scrum values describe behaviours that both Scrum Teams and the organisations they work within should exhibit.

When talking about an agile mindset, that includes the **Scrum
values**, the values and principles from the **Manifesto for Agile Software Development**, and **Lean Principles**. These values and principles guide the decisions that a Scrum Team makes, and they directly affect the effectiveness of that team in collaborating while using an empirical process to deliver valuable Product Increments.

Software development is complex and so are people. When things are going well, the complexity seems manageable. But when stuff starts hitting the fan, bad things can and do happen. These difficult moments are why we need the Scrum values.

Understanding the Scrum values can lead to **better decisions**, **higher-quality work**, and a **truly collaborative environment**.

<img src="/psm/docs/understanding-and-applying-scrum/assets/lists-63d25bd8.png">

**Lack of trust impacts all of the above Values.**

These values relate to the ethics of Scrum, thereby from a social point of view turning Scrum into a value system.

These values are critical to understanding the "WHY" of Scrum. They act as guideposts when your team gets lost. More importantly, they drive the decisions that impact your daily work. Failing to understand them prevents your team from improving their ability to deliver value.

The Scrum values can guide you through the many obstacles and difficult situations that inevitably arise during software development projects. Without these values, practices rote and collaboration feels forced and mechanical.

**ü§ù Commitment**

**Commitment** means the Scrum Team members should commit to bringing their best efforts forward and helping each other succeed.

**Commitment** means the Scrum Team members should personally commit to achieving the Scrum Goals. Commitment is about **dedication and applies to the actions, the effort, not the final results.**

**Commitment** is vital because it can transform a team. It‚Äôs a promise to yourself, your teammates, and your organisation to do the very best work you can. If everyone on your Scrum team is committed to delivering a done increment of valuable product each and every sprint, you can accomplish great things together.

**People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.**

In a Scrum context the decisions we take, the steps we take, the way we play Scrum, the practices we add to Scrum, the activities we surround Scrum with should re-enforce these values, not diminish or undermine them:

- Commit to the team.
- Commit to quality.
- Commit to collaborate.
- Commit to learn. Commit to do the best we can, every day again.
- Commit to the Sprint Goal.
- Commit to be professional.
- Commit to self-organise.
- Commit to excellence.
- Commit to the agile principles. Commit to create working software.
- Commit to look for improvements.
- Commit to the Definition of Done.
- Commit to the Scrum framework.
- Commit to focus on Value.
- Commit to finish work.
- Commit to inspect & adapt. Commit to transparency.
- Commit to challenge the status-quo.

---

**üéØ Focus**

- **Focus** means everyone should be focused on the sprint goal and the desired outcome of the sprint. The product owner must be focused on value, while the development team should focus on delivery and quality under the watchful eye of the Scrum master, who‚Äôs focused on the team‚Äôs use of Scrum and on removing any impediment that blocks them from delivering the increment.

- **Focus** allows us to do our very best. Valuing focus means that we give people the time they need to think about their work. After all, creativity is hard enough without being constantly interrupted. Allowing development team members to focus just on one product, the current sprint, and the current sprint goal gives them the best chance of succeeding. Encourage the product owner to focus on the future value of the product while you, the Scrum master, focus on upholding Scrum.

**Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and goals of the Scrum team.**

---

**ü¶Å Courage**

- **Courage** is the linchpin of the other Scrum values. It takes courage to commit, to focus amid distractions, and to be open to new ideas. And it takes courage and faith in your teammates to count on having respectful interactions when you need to discuss problems.

- **Courage** means the Scrum team should have the courage needed to work transparently, to do the right thing‚Äîeven when it‚Äôs painful‚Äîand to tackle difficult challenges.

---

**‚ù§Ô∏è Respect**

- **Respect** creates a feeling of safety. Being open with others can be scary and admitting when you‚Äôre stuck is hard, but respect makes these actions easier. A high-performing Scrum team is built on mutual respect, and honest discussions create the safety needed to tackle difficult issues. Respect helps a team gel, grow, and learn together.

- **Respect** means the Scrum team members need to show respect for one another and for everyone outside the team, seeing them as capable, intelligent, and creative problem solvers who are each doing the best work they can.

---

**üö™ Openness**

- **Openness** is the core of transparency, which is what makes Scrum work. If the members of your Scrum team (and the people who work with your team) aren‚Äôt open with each other and the wider organization, they can‚Äôt solicit honest feedback or adapt their work accordingly. You need to be open and honest, even when you‚Äôre struggling or there‚Äôs a tough issue to address. If you aren‚Äôt, transparency will suffer.

- **Scrum is designed to keep failures small and manageable, making risk management a built-in feature of the framework. If your team can‚Äôt talk about its small failures openly, that increases the risk that big troubles are around the corner.

- **Openness** is more about the idea that you could be wrong about something, than it is about just being open and sharing your opinion.

üí° Coaching
{: .label .label-blue }

Scrum isn‚Äôt meant to be easy. It is designed to provoke change and change can push people outside their comfort zones. How can you tell if a Scrum Team are living and breathing the Scrum Values?

- [ ] Are they committed to the team‚Äôs goals or their own personal goals?
- [ ] Are they willing to collaborate and find solutions when things go wrong or do they throw their hands in the air and give up?
- [ ] Are they willing to try something else?
- [ ] Are they willing to volunteer for tasks they don‚Äôt particularly enjoy or that aren‚Äôt in their core skillset if it‚Äôs in the best interests of the team?
- [ ] Are the Scrum Team focussed on the Sprint Goal and able to stay focussed when distractions inevitably arise?
- [ ] Are they open to the idea that they may be wrong about something?
- [ ] Are they open to discovering alternative solutions or to asking people outside the team for their advice?
- [ ] Do they have a fixed mindset?
- [ ] Are they insular and part of a clique or are they willing to embrace alternative ideas and suggestions?
- [ ] Do they treat their team-members and co-workers with respect?
- [ ] Do they value the rest of the team and treat them as equals?
- [ ] Do they listen to other opinions without constantly interrupting?
- [ ] Do they turn up to meetings on time and are they present during the meetings?
- [ ] Do they have the courage to push back against unrealistic demands?
- [ ] Do they stand up and share their concerns?
- [ ] Do they challenge one another and hold each other accountable?
- [ ] Do they ask difficult questions and hold their hands up when they‚Äôve made a mistake?

- As a Scrum Master, you demonstrate servant leadership by coaching with the Scrum values.

**4 Ways to Coach with the Scrum Values** - Stephanie Ockerman, 2017

**1. Establish what the Scrum values mean to us as individuals and as a team.**
Teams need to form an identity in order to be effective - one piece of identity is understanding values.

Team members need to work through what their values actually mean to them because individuals each have different interpretations of values, and different teams will have different interpretations of values.

Questions to ask to coach with the Scrum values:

- [ ] What is important about [Scrum value]?
- [ ] What does it look like to honour [Scrum value] in our daily work?
- [ ] What does it look like to ignore [Scrum value] in our daily work?
- [ ] How does it feel to be in alignment with [Scrum value]?

If there are conflicts between individual values and the Scrum values, explore that further. Negotiation may be necessary to enable teams to be effective and individuals to feel in alignment with what matters to them.

**2. Use the Scrum values to help guide decision-making.**
Once teams have established what the Scrum values mean to them, the values can be used as a tool to help guide decision-making.  Scrum Masters can recognise when Scrum Teams get stuck when facing a challenging decision.  It could be about what to build, how to build something, processes, tools, relationships and interactions‚Ä¶ anything.

Questions to ask to coach with the Scrum values:

- [ ] What would [Scrum value] tell us about this decision?
- [ ] Which Scrum value feels most important for this decision?

**3. Observe and discuss outcomes and behaviours and refine what the Scrum values mean to us.**
The Scrum values discussion is not a one-time thing.  We will continuously encounter new situations that require more discovery of how we interpret and use the Scrum values.  We will also fail to honour our team commitments regarding the Scrum values. So we need to be inspecting and adapting on how we are living the Scrum values. Sprint Retrospectives are a great opportunity for this.

Reflective questions to ask to coach with the Scrum values:

- [ ] How did we honour [Scrum value] this Sprint?
- [ ] Which Scrum values helped us achieve [outcome]?
- [ ] Which values do we want to honour more?
- [ ] What will be possible when we honour this value?
- [ ] In what situations does it feel most difficult to honour [Scrum value]?

**4. Identify actions for improvement.**
A key part of coaching is moving to commitment and accountability. This is what helps people grow ‚Äì taking action after we have enough learning and discovery.

Commitment-focused questions to ask to coach with the Scrum values:

- [ ] When we honour [Scrum value], what are we saying yes to?
- [ ] When we honour [Scrum value], what are we saying no to?
- [ ] Who do we/you need to be in order to do [actionable commitment]?
- [ ] What can I do to support you with [actionable commitment]?

The Scrum Master does not own all of the actions for improvement. The individuals and the team own their commitments.

**Two ways you can help your team get more familiar with the Scrum values** - Ryan Ripley, Jan 2020

1.  During a Sprint retrospective, write each value across a board.
- [ ] Ask the team to come up with ways that they applied each value during the last sprint?
- [ ] Ask how the values were violated?

Use the responses to generate a discussion about each value - over time, this will create a common understanding about how each value applies to the team.

If the team is struggling with embracing the Scrum values, you can perform this exercise during every retrospective.

If the team is consistently working well together, you may not need to perform it very often (though you should still do it occasionally, just to keep the values fresh in everyone‚Äôs minds.)

2. If your team is more action-oriented, try framing each Scrum value as a product backlog item in the product backlog. For example: ‚Äú**As a __, I want to ____ in order to _____.**‚Äù Use this format to make these value stories‚Äô actionable. For example, ‚Äú**As a Scrum team member, I want to show up on time to Scrum events in order to show my teammates that I respect them.**‚Äù
