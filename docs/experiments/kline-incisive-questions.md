# Kline Incisive Questions
{: .no_toc }

The tool helps to identify “limiting beliefs” or “blocking assumptions” that might be stopping progress towards a goal. It is a questioning approach for use by a coach that can help identify freeing assumptions and hence unblock progress.

## What is the tool?

It is a sequence of questions posed to the client (part of Nancy Kline’s thinking approach). It starts by identifying the blocking assumptions (limiting beliefs), the more useful, freeing assumptions and then ideas that move towards the goal given the new assumption.

## How do you use it?

You might want to play with the language to make it feel more natural, but in essence the approach Nancy Kline describes is summarised as:

**What are your blocking assumptions to achieving your goal?**
- What might you be assuming that is stopping you from achieving your goal?
- Is it true?
- Which is limiting you most?

**What are more useful, freeing assumptions?**

**Ask the incisive questions**
If you absolutely knew that ... _freeing assumption_ ... what ideas would move you to your goal?
