##  Find Actions That Boost Both Integration and Autonomy

Organisations with self-managing Scrum Teams face the difficult challenge balancing their autonomy while keeping their work integrated with the rest of the organisation. Because both of these aspects are equally desirable, and we can’t simply make an either-or decision, we are faced with what is called a “wicked question”.

Instead of letting the pendulum swing entirely to one side, this experiment is about finding ways of supporting both sides. With this approach, you help groups move from “either-or” to “yes-and” thinking. This experiment and its corresponding worksheet are based on the Liberating Structure Integrated~Autonomy.

## Steps

1. Invite people who have a stake in either increasing the autonomy of Scrum Teams or keeping them integrated with work done elsewhere. This includes the Scrum Teams themselves, departments they depend on (and vice versa), and management.
