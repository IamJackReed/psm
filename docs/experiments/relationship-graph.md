# Relationship Graph
{: .no_toc }

This tool is useful for exploring many life or career transitions. It can be an effective way of exploring a clientâ€™s relationships with someone or something (e.g. a business, a role or job, a behaviour or a person such as a manager, partner, team member) whether this be a current or past issue. It can be helpful when there is any idealisation or demonisation going on (e.g. redundancy, divorce, death, endings) and can be helpful when your client: is debating whether to make a change e.g. leave a job; has recently made a change and is feeling unsure about it; is in a situation which feels similar to something they have experienced before.

## What is the tool?

The approach is a mix of drawing and the use of questions to explore the drawing. The approach starts by encouraging your client to draw a graph tracing their relationship. The course of the graph shows the emotional highs and lows. The exploration of these highs and lows can lead to new learning that can be applied to the transition they are facing. For current issues this can enable a review of how things have been in order to get more clarity on what the client wants to happen next; for past issues this can lead to resolution or understanding and learning.

## How do you use it?

Ensure your client has control over the plotting and drawing. Be open and relaxed about how the exercise is used rather than overly prescriptive.

Invite your client to describe and explore what they notice about the graph, for example:
- What does each part of the graph mean to them?
- What was influencing the highs? What about the low points?
- What were the key events and turning points? What influenced these?
- Do any key imperatives emerge?
- What learning can you draw from the graph?
- How do these now impact?
- What are the implications?
