##  Purpose Of This Experiment

This experiment is based on a collection of powerful questions to help your team reflect, learn and improve, continuously. We also described specific opportunities for when & how to use them. Not as facilitated retrospective formats, but as learning moments that can take place anywhere, anytime during the Sprint.

## Improve How You Learn As A Team

Teams and organisations are not always aware of how learning takes place. Single- and double-loop learning. It's based on the book On Organisational Learning by Chris Argyris.

**Single- And Double-Loop Learning**
Single-loop learning focuses on solving a problem within an existing system that is defined by sets of beliefs, structures, roles, procedures, and norms. Double-loop learning challenges the system itself. As an example of single-loop learning, a Scrum team might explore different techniques for estimating their Product Backlog for the purpose of forecasting. The Scrum team might also use double-loop learning to challenge the purpose of forecasting itself and look for other ways to satisfy the need to forecast. Another example of single-loop learning is when developers try to fix broken unit tests faster, whereas double-loop learning would see them question why their unit tests are so prone to breaking in the first place. A final example of single-loop learning is when a Product Owner tries to better capture requirements on the Product Backlog, whereas double-loop learning might make her question the need for detailed requirements in an empirical process in the first place.

So where single-loop learning improves what is possible within the current system, double-loop learning is about challenging and changing the system. Double-loop learning helps people change (sometimes deeply held) assumptions and beliefs.

**The Sprint Retrospective**
Fortunately, using the Scrum framework purposefully helps teams leverage both types of learning by creating transparency around how work is done, and by creating opportunities for inspection and adaptation. Although all Scrum events help teams to learn by inspecting and adapting, the Sprint Retrospective is the one that most directly reflects on how work is done. The benefits of this reflection are limited when it focuses only on finding new practices and techniques (single-loop) and doesn’t involve challenging underlying beliefs and rules (double-loop).

Teams affected tend to limit themselves to single-loop learning and can’t benefit from double- loop learning because their existing beliefs about management, products, how to manage people, and how to control risk remain unchallenged.

If your Sprint Retrospectives remain shallow and only engage your team in single-loop learning, your situation won't improve. We've found it helpful to frequently reflect with teams on how they learn. That may sound super abstract, but you'll discover one way to do this with this experiment. This kind of learning makes it more likely for teams to engage in double-loop learning (or even beyond).
