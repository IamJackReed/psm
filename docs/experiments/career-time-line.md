##  What is the tool?

This is a physical movement exercise, moving back through your client’s career, exploring key moments, and then moving back up the timeline again, further picking up your client’s experiences and strengths.

##  How do you use it?

**Stage One**
- Ask your client to imagine a line on the floor which represents their career.
- Ask them to identify the start of the line and the point which represents the present
time.
- Walk along, beside the line, together. having a look up and down it to get a sense of the career as a whole (dissociated).
- Ask them to identify 4 or 5 significant career points, going back as far as they like.

**Stage Two**
- Begin with their current role and ask client to stand on the line now (associated).
- Ask client to go through all their successes, wins, abilities, skills, responsibilities,
learning, positive feedback, etc.
- Do this for each career point – walking back down the line into their earlier career history.
- Coach asks questions to prompt awareness “what qualities did you have to make this happen?” etc. Coach can make notes if required.

**Stage Three**
- When all 4 or 5 career points have been explored, walk back up the line to the present day, encouraging your client to notice any more achievements and high points which they overlooked on the way down.
- Walk client back to the present day, gathering up all the realisations about their career and the part they have played in it
- Ask them to look back and acknowledge all they have achieved.
- Ask them to think about themselves at the beginning of their career and acknowledge
how much they have done and learned since then.

**Stage Four**
- Encourage your client to record the action that will be taken now to help progress their career to the next stage, the future.
- If time permits, ask client to look toward the future on the line and consider where they want to be in the future and what else they need to do or have to get them there.
