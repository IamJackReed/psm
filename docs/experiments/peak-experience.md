# Peak Experience
{: .no_toc }

This is an exercise that helps a client reflect on the learning from a high point in their life (or perhaps specifically in particular areas, such as their career). It can help a client think about the values that really helped to create these “peaks” (i.e. the values that were being met). This can then enable the client to reflect on how this learning applies in the present.

## What is the tool?

The approach is essentially a funnel of exploration. You start by identifying and exploring the peak experience itself. Then you explicitly explore the values that were being met. And then you bring this learning to the present. This can be an uplifting and motivational exercise for clients: take care of “peaks” that cannot be recreated (e.g. “if only I could have that time back again”).

## How do you use it?

You work with your client through a number of stages, exploring the “peak”, then bringing the learning to the present:

- Ask your client to describe a peak experience from their career or life when they were really fulfilled and happy.
- Your role as coach is to elicit a really good “state” in the client (enjoy it with them!).
- Explore which values were being met.
- How far are those values still appropriate today?
- How far are those values being met today?
- Assuming those values are still important, what actions could your client take to ensure the values are met more fully?
- Explore the costs and benefits of decisions.
