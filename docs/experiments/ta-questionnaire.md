# TA Questionnaire
{: .no_toc }

The questionnaire helps clients to identify their “drivers” (based on the theory of Transactional Analysis). You can then help your client consider the implications and changes they want to make.

## What is the tool?

The questionnaire involves 60 questions. The scoring then places the responses into five categories: be strong; be perfect, try harder; please me; hurry up.

## How do you use it?

The first step is to encourage your client to complete the questionnaire itself (it is a self- score questionnaire and takes just a few minutes to complete).

Each response is then entered on a grid and totalled for each “driver” (this is a simple exercise and the completion of the questionnaire and scoring can all be carried out as homework if required).

The profile that emerges can then form the basis of your ongoing coaching.

## TA Questionnaire
Give each statement a score and when you have finished, transpose the scores into the grid.

## Interpretation

Adults have the responsibility of ensuring that children grow up equipped to take their place in life in as happy and fulfilling a way as possible: they give their children guidelines about values to help them understand how to do this. However, children are unable to understand the complexities of the guidelines and convert adult instructions into rules.

These rules become rigid, repetitive patterns of thought, feelings and behaviour which tend to take over in times of stress. If adults have rigid patterns of their own, they tend to reinforce the same values in their children.
