# Triad Meetings
{: .no_toc }

Triad meetings can be used by organisations (whether corporate, public, sports team, school, charity etc) and coaches as a way of establishing an agreed purpose when there is more than one party involved.

## What is the tool?

Together with the individuals involved the meeting typically represents an opportunity to:
- Agree on the process, outcomes and objectives of coaching
- Agree how (and whether) success will be measured
- Providing clarity on confidentiality and the coaching process.

## How do you use it?

The format will vary depending on context but might typically involve:

- Coach – setting the scene and meeting objectives
- Client (i.e. the person you will coach) – sharing their (public) goals
- Third party (e.g. line manager, sponsor, teacher etc.) – what would outstanding look like? What do they want to see as outcome? What is already brilliant? What change are they looking for? How can they help and support? Feedback?
- All – how will we measure?
- Coach – confidentiality and updating

A similar format can also be used part-way through a coaching assignment, or at the end as an assessment of progress and to ensure sustainability of learning.
