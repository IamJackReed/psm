# Ask Five People
{: .no_toc }

It is a way of gathering feedback from different areas of your life, with a particular emphasis on understanding strengths. It can also be used in different ways to how a standard performance, or 360, review might be used. For example, you can ask your client to consider getting feedback from people outside the workplace and your client can also take full responsibility for the collation and consideration of the feedback.

##  What is the tool?

Five questions are asked of (at least) five people. These provide valuable insights for your client and enables them to consider themes and build self-awareness of their strengths.

## How do you use it?

Ask your client to ask at least 5 people (whose opinions they respect and trust) from different areas of their life, the following questions:

1. What one word or phrase describes me best?

2. What do you think is my greatest achievement?

3. What do you value most about me?

4. What one thing could I change for my own benefit?

5. What do you believe to be my greatest strength?

You can encourage your client to approach people they might not usually ask for feedback (often those who know us best might not be our work colleagues) or to contrast feedback from different areas of their life to explore recurring patterns.

You can leave the collation method to your client (although they will often choose to simply email the respondents).
