##  What is the tool?

This is a cognitive behavioural model: it starts with the situation where self-limiting beliefs are triggered and moves through to exploring and reframing as appropriate. The first three stages (A-C) are about the role self-limiting beliefs are currently playing for the client; the second three stages (D-F) are about disputing these and developing new beliefs.

## How do you use it?

As a coach guide the conversation through the 6 stages of the model (keeping all your coaching skills and beliefs front-of-mind):

A) **Activating** event or situation (e.g. giving a presentation)

B) Self-limiting **Beliefs** about the situation (e.g. I must perform perfectly otherwise
colleagues will think I am stupid)

C) **Consequences** of those beliefs (e.g. anxiety, poor concentration, avoidance)

D)  **Disputing** the self-limiting beliefs (e.g. How is this helping me? What’s the worst that can happen? Am I being realistic?)

E)  **Effective** new beliefs (e.g. holding onto this idea will make me more anxious. This is an opportunity to get people excited about this topic & get others involved)

F)  New **Feelings** (e.g. more confident, see presentation as a challenge & opportunity rather than an ordeal).
