# Metaphor Through Picture Cards
{: .no_toc }

The use of metaphor can be a powerful approach within coaching that can help clients to shift perspective. You can combine this with the use of picture cards to quickly move from rational, logical thinking to creative, open thinking, tapping into how your client is thinking, feeling and experiencing their world.

## What is the tool?

You encourage your client to select pictures from a selection of cards (or you can work with physical objects) and use their selection to explore what is going on for them.

## How do you use it?

This is an approach which you can freely experiment with. However, one method is to use this alongside three stages:

- What is going on?
- What do you want instead?
- How might you get what you want?

At each stage ask your client to select a card in response to the question. Then explore the metaphor between the question and their selection. Explore the metaphor: e.g. “what is it like?”, “how does it feel?”, “what is it similar to?”, “what does it smell like?”.

Remember to work with your client’s metaphor and description, rather than making assumptions or changing the words used to describe the metaphor (otherwise it becomes your metaphor not theirs).
