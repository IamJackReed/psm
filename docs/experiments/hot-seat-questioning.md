# Hot Seat Questioning
{: .no_toc }

Hot seat questioning is a way of generating multiple questions for an individual (or a team) facing an issue. It can also be a powerful way of demonstrating the value of asking questions over giving solutions.

## What is the tool?

In essence the tool is used by a team, or a group, enabling each team member in turn to ask a question of a person facing an issue or dilemma. The person facing the issue doesn’t answer, but instead reflects on the question and makes a note of their response. It is therefore a way of generating a wide range of questions and prevents the opportunity for potentially defensive responses.

## How do you use it?

- The group member – the “client” - briefly outlines case study/problem they are wrestling with.
- Rest of group can ask clarification questions if essential at this stage & write down couple of questions to help generate mobility in client.
- Intention is to stimulate client’s thinking (as opposed to questions on external factors)
- Group members ask their question in turn – client does not answer but simply makes note of each question.
- Allow a little time to think after each question.
- Group repeat with second questions.
- Client now reflects on what has changed, insights and which questions were useful (and why).
- If appropriate few minutes to allow group members to “offer advice” & client to reflect on value of the advice.
