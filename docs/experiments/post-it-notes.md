## What is the tool?

The exercise involves the client identifying their beliefs, examining each one, and making a conscious choice about the belief, with the opportunity to reframe (or destroy) limiting or unhelpful beliefs.

## How do you use it?

The client writes on post it notes:
- Beliefs about yourself (empowering and limiting).
- Labels you wear or have worn (empowering or limiting).

Working with your coach, examine each one in turn:
- Is it true?
- Is it helpful?
- Was it true once?
- Where did it come from (and how reliable was the “witness”?).

Do one of 4 things with each post it:
- Keep it.
- Re-write it (re-frame it) so that it is more appealing or useful to you.
- Destroy it.
- Write some new ones.

Coach can join in with reframing or writing new ones if this would help the client.
