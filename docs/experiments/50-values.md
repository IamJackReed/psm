## What is the tool?

The exercise involves asking your client to select values from a range of cards, ask your client to create their own personal list of values (perhaps using the following as a starting point) and to review their behaviour against each value.

## How do you use it?

Write each value on a separate index card or print them out:

| ACHIEVEMENT 	| HELPING OTHERS| QUALITY 	|  ADVANCEMENT	| HONESTY 	|
|:---:	|:---:	|:---:	|:---:	|:---: |
|**RECOGNITION**|**CHALLENGE**|**INDEPENDENCE**|**RELIGION**|
|**CHANGE**|**INFLUENCING OTHERS**|**REPUTATION**|**INNER HARMONY**|
|**RESPONSIBILITY**|**COMPETENCE**|**INTEGRITY**|**SECURITY**|
|**COMPETITION**|**INVOLVEMENT**|**SELF-RESPECT**|**COOPERATION**|
|**JOB TRANQUILITY**|**SOPHISTICATION**|**CREATIVITY**|**KNOWLEDGE**|
|**STABILITY**|**STABILITY**|**DECISIVENESS**|**LEADERSHIP**|
|**STATUS**|**DEMOCRACY**|**LOYALTY**|**SUPERVISING OTHERS**|
|**EFFECTIVENESS**|**MEANINGFUL WORK**|**WEALTH**|**EFFICIENCY**|
|**NATURE**|**WISDOM**|**EXCELLENCE**|**PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT**|
|**WORK UNDER PRESSURE**|**EXCITEMENT**|**FREEDOM**|**WORK WITH OTHERS**|
|**FRIENDSHIPS**|**POWER AND AUTHORITY**|**WORKING ALONE**|**TIMELINESS**|
|**PRIVACY**|

Then ask the client to select the ones that they most associate themselves with and to discard the rest. Ask the client to repeat this process until they have narrowed it down to six values.

Looking at the six selected values ask your client to state how much, on a scale of 1-10, they believe they act in alignment with each of them.

Finally, ask the client to state what specifically they can and will do to increase their alignment scores.
