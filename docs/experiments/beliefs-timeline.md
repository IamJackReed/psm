# Beliefs Timeline
{: .no_toc }

This tool is especially powerful for revisiting the formation of beliefs earlier in our lives. It enables clients to look at such periods, or moments, through their adult lens, and through this can facilitate the reframing of limiting beliefs, to more positive, liberating beliefs.

##  What is the tool?

This is a physical movement exercise, walking along the client’s timeline, back to critical periods, or moments, and then exploring these through the benefit of adult hindsight. The learning can then be applied back to the present.

##  How do you use it?

The principles of association and disassociation are important when working with timelines:

**Association**
- Getting the client to connect with a particular state, be it a current pleasant experience, a previous powerful experience, a future desirable situation.

- Speaking in the first person and the present tense “I am...”.

- Useful for really getting the client to feel what it was or is like to be in that place.

**Dissociation**
- Getting the client to “step outside” of their experience & stand back as an observer.

- Speaking in the third person or the past tense “This is a person who...” “I did this...”.

- Very helpful when someone struggles to speak about themselves positively. Step back and ask “Looking at that person, what do you think of them?”.

The process for the beliefs timeline:
- Think back to an event from your life.

- Walk alongside your timeline, dissociated until you reach that point.

- Watch what was happening as an observer.

- What did you do?

- What did other people do?

- Notice how it was impossible for you to control every aspect.

- What were you trying to achieve? What were others trying to achieve?

- With the benefit of hindsight, what would you like to have happened?

- Imagine yourself doing it.

- You can also image yourself as an adult going to your assistance.

- See the situation resolving itself differently.

- When you are ready, step onto your timeline and live out the new experience in an
associated way.

- Step off and repeat 5 or 6 times – FAST

- Eventually stay on your timeline and take what you learned from that incident to help you in the future. Leave the pain behind
