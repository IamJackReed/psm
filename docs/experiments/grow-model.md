# GROW Model
{: .no_toc }

The GROW model is one way of structuring a coaching conversation. You can use it implicitly as a guide for yourself as coach to move through the four stages from establishing the outcome of the conversation through to the commitment to the client’s plan.

##  What is the tool?

There are four stages:

**Goals**
- Agree topic for discussion.
- Agree specific objective of session o Set long-term aim if appropriate.

**Reality**
- Invite self-assessment.
- Offer specific feedback examples o Avoid or check assumptions.
- Discard irrelevant history.

**Options**
- Cover the full range of options.
- Invite suggestions from the client o Offer suggestions carefully.
- Ensure choices are made.

**Wrap-up** (or Will)
- Commit to action.
- Identify possible obstacles o Make steps specific.
- Define timing.
- Agree support.

## How do you use it?

The four stages are just a guide: be prepared to move back through the stages as required (for example, when discussing options, you might find it appropriate to go back and revisit the goals). At each stage ask appropriate questions (examples are given below). Remember though, this just provides a structure for a coaching conversation: for example, it needs to be combined with high quality listening and a coaching attitude throughout:

**Goals**
- What are your objectives for this situation? o What do you want to happen?
- What do you want to avoid?

**Reality**
- What is most important to you?
- What and how great is your concern about the current issue? (1-10).
- What obstacles will need to be overcome?
- What internal obstacles do you have to taking action?
- What steps have you taken so far?
- What has stopped you doing more?
- What is really the nub of the issue here?

**Options**
- What are all the different, creative ways in which you could approach this
issue? Make a list.
- What would you do differently if you had more time or more authority?
- Which of these solutions feels best to you?
- Which would give the best outcome for you?
- Which would give the best outcome for others?

**Wrap/Will**
- Star the most promising ideas
o How could you improve on the promising ideas?
- To what extent do they meet your objectives?
- What are the costs (financial or otherwise) of adopting these ideas?
- What could hinder you from adopting these ideas?
- What support do you need and from whom?
- How much more clarity do you now have about the original issue?
- What commitment do you have on a scale of 1 – 10?
- What would need to be different to raise your commitment?
- What precisely are you going to do next and when?
- Is there anything else?
