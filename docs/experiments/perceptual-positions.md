# Perceptual Positions
{: .no_toc }

This is an exercise that helps consider specific relationships in your client’s workplace or life more generally. It can be especially useful where there are difficulties in relationships, perhaps recurring problems or longstanding issues. For example, perhaps your client is experiencing a difficulty with a particular member of their team, with their boss or colleague, or with a stakeholder for an important project.

You might use it simply to explore what is happening, or perhaps as part of a process to help the client prepare for an upcoming interaction. the present.

## What is the tool?

The tool is based on the principle of physical movement, associating and disassociating your client from a number of positions as the exercise unfolds, namely: their own “first” position; the “other”, “second” position; the “third” position of a detached observer; and, finally, back to the “first position”.

## How do you use it?

- Client stands in “First Position” looking at and thinking about somebody (in position two) with whom they have a difficulty. Coach asks “What are you experiencing, thinking, feeling?” Keep the client associated and stop any story or justification.
- Client stands in “Second Position” looking at and thinking about person in First Position (themselves). Client lives the part of the person in “Second Position”, coach asks their name (need not be the real name) and coach addresses the client by this name. “What are you experiencing, thinking and feeling?” Keep the client associated in Second Position (this can be especially important for the second position as clients can slip back into “position one”).
- Client stands in “Third Position” – detached, objective, observer. Coach asks the client to focus on the person in First Position and asks “How do you respond to what is happening there?”. The client is talking to First Position with objectivity and detachment and with all the useful resources from Third Position to First Position.
- Now ask your client to walk back to the first position brining all of the new thoughts and knowledge with them from the previous positions. With the client back in the “First Position”, looking towards the “Second Position”, ask “how is this different now?”
