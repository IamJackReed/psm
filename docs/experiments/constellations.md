# Constellations
{: .no_toc }

The approach can raise the awareness of the (often invisible) systems at play which can entangle clients outside their conscious awareness. It can be useful if your client is expressing strong feelings about how a team, group, family or system is working or not working.

##  What is the tool?

The approach is to focus on the “big picture” view of the system, helping your client step back and see things more clearly by looking at the whole system. The focus is on the connections, relationships and interactions without getting caught up in the detail and story.

##  How do you use it?

You can use anything that helps represent the system and helps your client stand back and view objectively (e.g. drawing, cards, physical objects, plasticine – or other people in a team setting).

- Ask your client to model a representation of their system.
- Keep asking questions from a systemic perspective.
- What do you notice; feel; think?
  - What can you do or take care of?
  - What part do you play?
  - What changes can happen?
  - How are others feeling?
  - What will make a difference to the system?
- Stay with a coaching attitude throughout.
- Work with what emerges.
