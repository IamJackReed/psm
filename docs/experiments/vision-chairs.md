# Vision Chairs
{: .no_toc }

Changing behaviours can be difficult and often knowledge of the need to change is not enough. This exercise is a way of finding the levers to motivate change (e.g. towards pleasure, away from pain) and a way of associating current behaviours and actions with longer term outcomes and consequences. Ultimately it is about helping your client “take the blinkers off”, gain perspective and objectivity. It can be used for business or personal goals and for decision-making. It is good for clients who have previously not met their goal but continue to want to achieve it.

## What is the tool?

It is a physical movement exercise, using three positions (ideally three chairs): “now”; the future state without change; the future state with change. Using the chairs you help the client consider the alternative scenarios.

## How do you use it?

**Sitting in Chair 1**
Carry out a general assessment of the client’s current situation:
- What is working?
- What isn’t working?
- How do you feel about it?
- How has your behaviour (for better or worse) contributed to creating your
present situation?
- How have your actions over the last xx years helped shape your present self and
circumstances?

**Looking at Chair 2 from Chair 1**
Now think about x years ahead (the client states how far forward they want to look).
How will it be if you continue to act in exactly the same way? Ask your client to look at this potential future scenario and ask:
- What do you see when you look at this person?
-  What do you think and feel when you look at this person?

Ask if they want to go and sit in that chair to experience what that feels like (they usually choose not to).

**Looking at Chair 3 from Chair 1**
Now think about x years ahead if they do everything that could get them what they really want – help them to build the picture. Ask them to look at this potential future scenario and ask:
- What do you see when you look at this person?
- What do you think and feel when you look at this person?

Invite them to sit in the chair and speak as if they had already achieved this position. Invite them to tell Chair 1 how they achieved it. What steps did they take?
Whilst they are doing this write down the list of things they are telling you – hand this list to them at the end of the session.

**Move back to Chair 1 (today’s reality)**
Watch out for:
- If working with young people or children, then expect the time scales to be much shorter. Probably not more than 3-6 months.
- Do not use this exercise on terminally ill or old people.
- As coach you will need to make sure you keep your client firmly in each position.
Keeping them associated or dissociated accordingly.
- If there has not been much change or emotion you can revisit or ask your client to extend how far ahead they are looking, to increase the outcomes of action or no action. Do not over complicate this exercise with lots of additional coaching questions. Keep to the process.
