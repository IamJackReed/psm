# McClelland Values
{: .no_toc }

David McClelland’s model of values can help people identify why they do what they do. Values are the activities, behaviours, beliefs, qualities or goals that you believe are important, they affect the choices we make and the satisfaction with the outcomes of these choices. McClelland’s framework provides a way of exploring these. As an example, it can be helpful for leaders who want to shift their leadership styles (e.g. away from dissonant styles to more resonant styles) as it can help understand what influences their choice of situational styles.

## What is the tool?

McClelland describes three values: achievement, affiliation and power:

**Achievement**
If you value achievement the most then you place a lot of importance to achieving, on doing things well and on making wise use of your time and resources to achieve more. Given a choice between doing something yourself and having someone else do it so they can learn how, you would probably choose to do it yourself (you can do it right and quickly).

>Performing better:
>- Outperforming others
>- Internal standards of excellence
>- Unique or innovative accomplishment
>- Long-range planning

**Affiliation**
If you value affiliation the most you will place the highest priority on avoiding conflict and maintaining good relations. Given a choice between doing something yourself and delegating it, if you think the other person would resent the work, you would do it yourself rather than create tension.

>Close friendly relations:
>- Establishing close, friendly relationships
>- Concern about separation or disruption of relationships
>- Seeing group activities as social

**Power**
If you value power the most you prefer positions of prestige and influence so that you can have an impact on what happens. Given a choice between doing something yourself and having someone else do it, you would choose to have them do it so that they can learn and develop. In this way you are using socialised power to have an impact on the person’s development.

>Feelings of being perceived as strong, effective, influential:
>- Taking forceful actions that affect people
>- Giving unsolicited support or advice
>- Controlling or regulating people’s lives
>- Influencing, persuading
>- Impressing individuals or the world at large
>- Acting in a way that generates strong positive or negative emotions in others
>- Having a concern for reputation or position

## How do you use it?

- Work with your client to explore their values against this framework
- How important are these values to you? (e.g. you can just discuss this, or even “score”):
>5 = extremely important
>4 = very important
>3 = important
>2 = of some importance
>1 =of little importance
>0 = unimportant
- What are the consequences of these values in your life, your work, your leadership, your coaching etc?
- How might they help, and hinder? For example, how might they influence the choice of different behaviours?
- What could you do to tune them up (or down) in particular situations?
