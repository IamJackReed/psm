# Inner Cast of Characters
{: .no_toc }

The tool can help with improving performance or stopping a destructive or self-defeating behaviour, helping a client explicitly identify what they might need to “dial-up” or “dial- down” in their own thinking, hence working with conflicting thoughts.

## What is the tool?

It encourages the client to consider a “board of directors” or “cast of characters” that is influencing their thinking (i.e. the head office, boardroom or control room in their own head), considering each in turn and being explicit about what needs to change.

## How do you use it?

Your client will be considering a situation that they would like to change or a behaviour they would like to improve (e.g. living more healthily, delegating more, managing boundaries better, being more patient, less perfectionist, less of a people pleaser etc). Set the exercise up with your client, ensuring they are relaxed and that they know there is no pressure on them to be creative or inventive, just to work with what comes to mind.

Ask them to imagine the different characters at play in the mind when they think of the situation. Be curious with them about the characters, exploring them together, and see what emerges:

- Who are the characters?
- Who is in charge?
- Who else is there?
- What are their roles?
- How do they look; Sound, Stand, Walk?
- What is their intention?
- What do they each want?
- How do they interact with each other?
- Who is holding back your progress?
- Who needs to stay, go or be given a new role?
- Who needs to be tuned up or tuned down?
- Who is the loudest?
- Who needs to be heard more?
- Check with all characters that any changes will be ok.
