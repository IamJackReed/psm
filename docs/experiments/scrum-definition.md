Scrum Guide - 2020
{: .label .label-green }

- Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organisations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.
- Scrum is simple. Try it as is and determine if its philosophy, theory, and structure help to achieve goals and create value.
- The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory.
- Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it.
- Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.
- Various processes, techniques and methods can be employed within the framework.
- Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of current management, environment, and work techniques, so that improvements can be made.
- Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage.
- The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not diminish or undermine them.
- How [maximising the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team] is done may vary widely across organisations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.
- Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value.
- The Scrum framework, as outlined herein, is immutable. While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices.

Insights
{: .label .label-yellow }

Scrum guide recommends using all the Scrum components and rules (not just the ones which suit). While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum.

- **Example 1** - _Scrum Team cannot decide that the Sprint Retrospective isn't needed._
- **Example 2** - _Developers cannot choose to skip the Daily Scrum event because they are busy writing code or developing the Product._

Scrum is:
- ❌ **Not a process, technique, or definitive method**
- ✅  **A framework** within which can employ various processes and techniques.
- ✅  Employs an **iterative, incremental approach to optimise predictability and to control risk.**
- ✅  Lightweight.
- ✅  Simple to understand.
