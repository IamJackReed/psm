## G.R.O.W
1. Create four columns on a large surface and write '**Goal**', '**Reality**', '**Options**' and '**Will**' as headings.

2. Agree on a '**Goal**' and write it in the first column. Do this by writing in silence on sticky notes. Then Theme Sort and Blind Vote.

Is this goal targeting a specific area? How will we measure progress towards this goal? Is the goal assignable (who is going to do it)? Is it realistic with the resources we have? Is the goal time limited? When do we want to see results?

3. Do the same for ‘Reality’ by answering the following:

- What is our starting point?
- What is happening now (what, who, when and how often)?
- What is the effect or result of this?
- Have we already taken any steps towards the goal?
- Does this goal conflict with any other goals or objectives that we have?

4. Explore the ‘**Options**’; Crazy Eights is a helpful tactic to generate lots of ideas quickly.

- What else could we do?
- What if certain constraints were removed?
- Would that change things? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each option?
- What factors or considerations will we use to weigh the options?
- What do we need to stop doing in order to achieve this goal?
- What obstacles stand in our way?

5. Establish ‘Will’ by committing to action some of the options. To help you clarify use: Who? What? When?
