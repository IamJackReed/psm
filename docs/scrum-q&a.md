### One of the Scrum events is the Sprint Review. How does the Sprint Review enable empiricism? What would the impact be if some members of the Scrum Team were not present?

**Answer:** The Sprint Review enables empiricism by providing the Scrum Team and the interested stakeholders to inspect the Increment and adapt the backlog. In addition, the Sprint Review supports transparency because everyone can see what has been produced in the Sprint.

If only part of the Scrum team were present, there would be less transparency. The Scrum Team members who were not present lose the opportunity to hear the feedback provided during the review directly. Directly hearing from stakeholders increases their understanding of what the stakeholders want.

### How does Scrum encourage ethical behaviour, doing "the right thing", in product development?

**Answer:**
This is achieved by sharing knowledge at the right time with the right people, gaining feedback (inspecting) and making changes (adaptations). Communication and collaboration happen when opportunities are discovered or present themselves. Scrum teams learn and grow as they work together. This often means how they grow professionally as individuals whilst improving their processes, tools and learning how to hold themselves and others accountable. For this, Scrum teams are guided by the Scrum Values; Commitment, Courage, Focus, Respect, and Openness - which, if lived by the Scrum team, brings the pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation to life.

The Scrum Guide says, "The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts. When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust."

### A fellow Scrum Master asks for your input. His team members see no value in defining a Sprint goal, and he has trouble explaining its use to them. What would you tell this Scrum Master?

**Answer:**
The Sprint Goal is essential. The Scrum Team commits to doing everything in their power to reach this goal. It explains why the team is doing what it does. It offers flexibility as well. When new discoveries are made during the Sprint, the team determines how to address them. They are free to do this in any way that does not endanger the sprint goal. Without a Sprint Goal, you are not doing Scrum.

### What is meant by a team or organisation practising 'zombie' or 'mechanical' Scrum?

**Answer:**
Mechanical or Zombie Scrum is focused on following the rules, going through the motions, perhaps having the roles and events but without the heart of Scrum. Practising "Real" Scrum instead focuses on being value-driven, focusing on goals and impact, the Scrum core values of Courage, Focus, Commitment, Respect and Openness, continuous improvement, and delighting stakeholders and end-users. "Real" Scrum also acknowledges that Scrum is a framework that leaves room for discovering additional practices that help support these core values.

### Every Sprint has a Sprint Review. So what is the purpose and result of this event?

**Answer:**
During the Sprint Review, the result of the Sprint is inspected.
The Scrum Team's event, which presents the results of their work to key stakeholders, and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed. The Scrum Team might provide additional information about what was delivered, and the challenges faced. Stakeholders at the event inspect the Product by using it and giving feedback. If the work is done and accepted, it will be added to the Product Increment. Work not accepted is returned to the Product Backlog. Inspecting the Product will give new insight into the direction the Product is taking. Conversations about what is needed next will take place. The Product Owner can use this information to update the Product Backlog. The result is heightened transparency for all involved (Scrum Team and stakeholders). Work has been inspected, either added to the Product Backlog or needing more work, and an updated Product Backlog based on the latest state of the Product.

### On a project with one Product Backlog, your management has given you six Scrum Teams. As the Scrum Master - What criteria should you use when you distribute the Product Backlog items among the Scrum Teams?

**Answer:**
According to the Scrum Guide, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where the Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
Hence, the Scrum Master does not distribute work from Product Backlog, the Scrum Teams are self-managing, and they are empowered and encouraged to select their own work items while collaborating with the Product Owner. Therefore, all Scrum Teams working on the same Product should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.
The Scrum Master could facilitate the Sprint Planning, working with the Product Owner, minimising dependencies between teams, and helping the Scrum Teams to inspect and adapt their workload based on their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done. By doing so, they become more confident about what they can forecast for the Sprint. Then, using Sprint Reviews to inspect the combined, integrated Increment the Scrum teams produce and adapt accordingly.

### A new Scrum Team wonders whether testing should be done within every Sprint. Describe the benefits of including testing within the Sprint's development activities. What does Scrum say about this?

**Answer:**
Product Increment creates transparency for the inspection and adaptation. All not tested and validated work reduces transparency and poses a risk resulting from increasing the unfinished work, and then this inspected Increment is not really potentially usable or releasable. In addition, when it comes to its release, there's a risk of having a lot to do to fix bugs. So adding testing activities, perhaps including in the Definition of Done, provides more confidence that the Increment will be in a done state and can be adequately inspected.

### During a retrospective, one of the more junior developers confesses he has a hard time getting his opinion heard. When discussing the work, the more experienced developers often don't let him finish his sentences or disregard what he has to say. What Scrum Values are touched upon here?

**Answer:**
Mainly: Courage, Respect, Openness.
Courage because the junior developer shows the courage to address a sensitive issue.
Respect, because in Scrum, we respect everyone involved.
Openness because in Scrum, we're open to everyone's input, experience, and background.
No matter if you're junior, senior, a customer, or the CEO.

### Describe the difference between a feature and component teams and how they hold up when viewed from the perspective of the Scrum Guide.

**Answer:**
Feature teams work cross-functionally on an end-user valuable part of the Product—for example, a website's search function or a list of images.
Component teams work on layers of the Product. For example, the database team works on the database containing the website's data, the frontend team develops the User Interface part of the website.

From a Scrum perspective, Cross-functional teams are preferred, as they can deliver front-to-back working products within their team. Delivering valuable working products almost always involves several layers/components to deliver one feature. It is stated in the Scrum Guide, "Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value for each Sprint. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how."

### One of the Scrum events is the Sprint Review. How does the Sprint Review enable empiricism? What would the impact be if some members of the Scrum Team were not present?

**Answer:**
The Sprint Review enables empiricism and provides an opportunity for the Scrum Team and the interested stakeholders to inspect the Increment and adapt the backlog. In addition, the Sprint Review supports transparency because everyone can see what has been produced in the Sprint.

If only part of the Scrum team was present, there would be less transparency. The Scrum Team members who were not present lose the opportunity to directly hear the feedback provided during the review. Directly hearing from stakeholders increases their understanding of what the stakeholders want.

### In what way does Scrum encourage ethical behaviour, doing "the right thing", in product development?

**Answer:**
Encouragement of ethical behaviour is driven primarily by the Scrum Values. Of course, these values don’t just miraculously transform a Scrum Team overnight or an organisation to suddenly become more ethical. However, it is the ‘encouragement of’ that leads to people to become more proficient in living the five Scrum Values; Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage. Organisations are more likely to see positive ethical behaviour.

The Scrum Guide says "The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts. When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust."

### A fellow Scrum Master asks for your input. His team members see no value in defining a Sprint goal and he has trouble explaining its use to them. What would you tell this Scrum Master?

**Answer:**
The Sprint Goal is extremely important. The Scrum Team commits to doing everything in their power to reach this goal. It explains why the team is doing what it does. It offers flexibility as well. When new discoveries are made during the Sprint, the team determines how to address them. They are free to do this in any way that does not endanger the sprint goal. Without a Sprint Goal, you are not doing Scrum.

Work has been inspected, either added to the Product Backlog or needing more work, and an updated Product Backlog based on the latest state of the Product.

### On a project with one Product Backlog, your management has given you six Scrum Teams.

As the Scrum Master.

### A new Scrum Team wonders whether testing should be done within every Sprint. Describe the benefits of including testing within the Sprint's development activities. What does Scrum say about this?

**Answer:**
Product Increment creates transparency for the inspection and adaptation. All not tested and validated work reduces transparency and poses a risk as a result of increasing the undone work, and then this inspected Increment is not really potentially usable or releasable. When it comes to its release, there's a risk of having a lot to do to fix bugs. So adding testing activities, perhaps including in the Definition of Done, provides more confidence that the Increment will be in a done state and can be properly inspected.

### During a retrospective, one of the more junior developers confesses he has a hard time getting his opinion heard. When discussing the work to be done, the more experienced developers often don't let him finish his sentences or disregard what he has to say. What Scrum Values are touched upon here?

They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how."

### Prior to the 2011 version of Scrum, the Development Team would "commit" to the Product Owner how much Product Backlog it would do during the upcoming Sprint during the Sprint Planning meeting. The word "commit" was replaced in 2011 by "forecast".

In your experience:
What will be the positive results of this change?
What will be the negative consequences of this change?
Why was this change made?

**Answer:**
Forecast, to me, suggests weather forecasting, so we are trying our best guest given the circumstances and what is known, so we are trying to predict what will happen, but that is what it is, just a prediction, and these can vary. As a positive result, I understand that when forecasting we might dedicate more to discussing what we know, what we can do, and by doing so, we might suffer from a less stressful word for everyone and try our best.

For the negative consequences, it can be that some people may be too relaxed and take it too lightly, so it is important that the Scrum Master teaches Scrum values and principles and what are their meanings properly to everyone working with Scrum.
This change was made because the word commitment used to be taken as a guarantee, but that is impossible in the complex domain and complex type of work like software development, and in many situations, that harms a team from some type of command-and-control approach, where punishments might happen like having to work overtime because of the "commitment

### The Daily Scrum is an event that happens every day. What would be the consequences if it were held every third day?

**Answer:**
When the Daily Scrum does not happen every day, it might endanger transparency, since the opportunities to inspect and adapt the Sprint Backlog it is reduced or lowered. It can lead to slow making decisions on what to do next, impediments are raised and resolved more slowly, communication between Developers could suffer, and unnecessary meetings might be created that might hinders their focus and it could be prevented by having a Daily every day.

### What artifacts are part of Scrum, and during which Scrum Events are they likely to be the subject of inspection?

**Answer:**
The Sprint Backlog is inspected during Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, and Sprint Review.
The Product Backlog is inspected during Sprint Planning and Sprint Review.
The Product Increment is inspected during Sprint Planning and Sprint Review.

Each Scrum artifact now posses a commitment, introduced in the Scrum Guide 2020 version as:
- For the Product Backlog, it is the Product Goal.
- For the Sprint Backlog, it is the Sprint Goal.
- For the Increment, it is the Definition of Done.

Apart from that: all artifacts may be inspected at any time, and be the subject of conversation at any time. Scrum prescribes frequent inspection, as long as it doesn't hinder the work being done.
Backlog Management and Backlog Refinement inspect the Product Backlog but is not a Scrum event in the strict sense.

### The developers in your Scrum Team raise an impediment. The work planned for the upcoming Sprint involves certain knowledge and expertise they do not possess within the team. How do you handle this impediment?

**Answer:**
An impediment is something the team might not be able to resolve in case they don't possess the ability or knowledge for it. The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, and coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality is an essential part of its accountabilities.

However, when an impediment cannot be addressed by the team, the Scrum Master must act and help remove the impediments.
The Scrum Master might ask if the expertise really needed? A conversation with the Product Owner could help, finding that another approach / changing scope is also viable. Perhaps a third-party can supply the code or service needed.

If the expertise really is needed, start by asking the team how they as a cross-functional team could gain the knowledge needed. Maybe time to learn, do research, training, or building a prototype could be enough. During sprint planning, outside experts may be consulted by the team. If none of this resolves the impediment, the Scrum Master can help the team getting the needed expertise from inside or outside the organisation available to them.

### How does the Cone of Uncertainty influence the work being done by a Scrum Team during a product's development lifetime?

**Answer:**
At the beginning of the Product's lifetime, many unknowns may exist. The team will work on removing these unknowns. For example by doing research, prototyping, testing with users. When important unknowns are uncovered, work can gradually include more functional stories adding valuable features. At the end of a product's development lifetime, work, in general, may decrease. The Unrealised Value is low, and the Current Value is high. Work will become more operational in nature. The Evidence-Based Management Guide can support and enhance how a product can deliver value to its customers by exploring the Key-Value Areas.

### In what ways does the Scrum Master attend the Sprint Retrospective?

**Answer:**
Oftentimes the Scrum Master may facilitate the Sprint Retrospective based on Scrum Team request.
More importantly, the Scrum Master joins the Sprint Retrospective as a Scrum Team member, inspecting people, processes, and tools, while helping the Scrum Team identifies and improve on the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness.

### One of the Scrum events is the Sprint Review. How does the Sprint Review enable empiricism? What would the impact be if some members of the Scrum Team were not present?

**Answer:**
The Sprint Review enables empiricism by providing an opportunity for the Scrum Team and the interested stakeholders to inspect the Increment and adapt the backlog. The Sprint Review supports transparency because everyone can see what has been produced in the Sprint.

If only part of the Scrum team was present, there would be less transparency. The Scrum Team members who were not present lose the opportunity to directly hear the feedback provided during the review. Directly hearing from stakeholders increases their understanding of what the stakeholders want.

### In what way does Scrum encourage ethical behaviour, doing "the right thing", in product development?

**Answer:**
In Scrum, we build quality working products that are valuable to our organisation and end-users. We are transparent about the work we do, challenges, and all uncertainties we face. We share knowledge, we communicate and collaborate with each other, we seek opportunities to inspect and adapt so we can improve ourselves and our process and tools, and hold ourselves and others accountable. We look beyond ourselves. In this, we are guided by the Scrum Values of Commitment, Courage, Focus, Respect, and Openness. It is also valuable to mention that when the team lives the values, the pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaption come to life.

The Scrum Guide says "The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts.

### The Product Owner is a part of the Scrum Team. How can you, as the Scrum Master, determine if the Product Owner is interacting with the Developers of the Scrum Team enough?

**Answer:**
First and foremost, it is important to define what "enough" means for yourself and for your Scrum Team. Engage in constant conversation with the team members and Product Owner individually, as well as in a group to gauge.

Observe if the Product Owner and the Developers collaborate throughout the Sprint, not only during Planning, Review, and Retrospectives in order to discuss and decide on the work's being performed, addressing issues, and making decisions accordingly. In case that is not the case, the Scrum Master teaches and coaches the Product Owner on improving her interactions with the Developers, discussing the impact of these low interactions can cause and harm.

Use the Sprint Reviews to check if the Product Owner can inspect the result of the Sprint produced by the Scrum Team, in case there are surprises, it might be an opportunity to improve their interactions in the next Sprint.

### One of the Scrum events is the Sprint Review. How does the Sprint Review enable empiricism? What would the impact be if some members of the Scrum Team were not present?

**Answer:**
The Sprint Review enables empiricism by providing an opportunity for the Scrum Team and the interested stakeholders to inspect the Increment and adapt the backlog. The Sprint Review supports transparency because everyone can see what has been produced in the Sprint.

If only part of the Scrum team was present, there would be less transparency. The Scrum Team members who were not present lose the opportunity to directly hear feedback provided during the Sprint review. Directly hearing from stakeholders increases their understanding of what the stakeholders want.

### In what way does Scrum encourage ethical behaviour, doing "the right thing", in product development?

**Answer:**
In Scrum, we build quality working products that are valuable to our organisation and end-users. We are transparent about the work we do, challenges, and all uncertainties we face. We share knowledge, we communicate and collaborate with each other, we seek opportunities to inspect and adapt so we can improve ourselves and our process and tools, and hold ourselves and others accountable. We look beyond ourselves. In this, we are guided by the Scrum Values of Commitment, Courage, Focus, Respect, and Openness. It is also valuable to mention that when the team lives the values, the pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaption come to life.

The Scrum Guide says "The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts. When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust."

### A fellow Scrum Master asks for your input. His team members see no value in defining a Sprint goal and he has trouble explaining its use to them. What would you tell this Scrum Master?

**Answer:**
The Sprint Goal is extremely important. The Scrum Team commits to doing everything in their power to reach this goal. It explains why the team is doing what it does. It offers flexibility as well. When new discoveries are made during the Sprint, the team determines how to address them. They are free to do this in any way that does not endanger the sprint goal. Without a Sprint Goal, you are not doing Scrum.

### What is meant by a team or organisation practicing 'zombie' or 'mechanical' Scrum?

**Answer:**
Mechanical or Zombie Scrum is focused on following the rules, going through the motions, perhaps having the roles and events but without the heart of Scrum. Practicing "Real" Scrum instead focuses on being value-driven, focusing on goals and impact, the Scrum core values of Courage, Focus, Commitment, Respect and Openness, continuous improvement, and delighting stakeholders and end-users. "Real" Scrum also acknowledges that Scrum is a framework, that leaves room for discovering additional practices that help support these core values.

### Every Sprint has a Sprint Review. What is the purpose and result of this event?

**Answer:**
During the Sprint Review, the result of the Sprint is inspected.
It's the Scrum Team's event, which presents the results of their work to key stakeholders, and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed. The Scrum Team might provide additional information about what was delivered and the challenges faced. Stakeholders at the event inspect the Product by using it and providing feedback. If the work is done and accepted, it will be added to the Product Increment. Work not accepted is returned to the Product Backlog. Inspecting the Product will give new insight into the direction the Product is taking. Conversations about what is needed next will take place. The Product Owner can use this information to update the Product Backlog. The result is heightened transparency for all involved (Scrum Team and stakeholders). Work has been inspected, either added to the Product Backlog or needing more work, and an updated Product Backlog based on the latest state of the Product.

### On a project with one Product Backlog, your management has given you six Scrum Teams. As the Scrum Master - What criteria should you use when you distribute the Product Backlog items among the Scrum Teams?

**Answer:**
According to the Scrum Guide, a Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where the Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.

Hence, the Scrum Master does not distribute work from Product Backlog, the Scrum Teams are self-managing, and they are empowered and encouraged to select their own work items while collaborating with the Product Owner. Therefore, all Scrum Teams working on the same Product should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.

The Scrum Master could facilitate the Sprint Planning, working with the Product Owner, minimising dependencies between teams, and helping the Scrum Teams to inspect and adapt their workload based on their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done, and by doing so, they become more confident on what they can forecast for the Sprint. Then, using Sprint Reviews to inspect the combined, integrated Increment the Scrum teams produce and adapt accordingly.

### A new Scrum Team wonders whether testing should be done within every Sprint. Describe the benefits of including testing within the Sprint's development activities. What does Scrum say about this?

**Answer:**
Product Increment creates transparency for the inspection and adaptation. All not tested and validated work reduces transparency and poses a risk as a result of increasing the undone work, and then this inspected Increment is not really potentially usable or releasable. When it comes to its release, there's a risk of having a lot to do to fix bugs. So adding testing activities, perhaps including in the Definition of Done, provides more confidence that the Increment will be in a done state and can be properly inspected.

### During a retrospective, one of the more junior developers confesses he has a hard time getting his opinion heard. When discussing the work to be done, the more experienced developers often don't let him finish his sentences or disregard what he has to say. What Scrum Values are touched upon here?

**Answer:**
Mainly: Courage, Respect, Openness.
C- ourage because the junior developer shows the courage to address a sensitive issue.
- Respect, because in Scrum we respect everyone involved.
- Openness because in Scrum, we're open to everyone's input, experience, and background.
No matter if you're junior, senior, a customer, or the CEO.

### Describe the difference between a feature and component teams, and how they hold up when viewed from the perspective of the Scrum Guide.

**Answer:**
Feature teams work cross-functionally on an end-user valuable part of the Product. For example, the search function of a website or a list of images.
Component teams work on layers of the Product. For example, the database team works on the database containing the website's data, the frontend team develops the User Interface part of the website.

From a Scrum perspective. Cross-functional teams are preferred, as they can deliver front-to-back working products within their team. Delivering valuable working products, almost always involves several layers/components to deliver one feature. It is stated in the Scrum Guide "Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how."

### Prior to the 2011 version of Scrum, the Development Team would "commit" to the Product Owner how much Product Backlog it would do during the upcoming Sprint during the Sprint Planning meeting. The word "commit" was replaced in 2011 by "forecast". In your experience: What will be the positive results of this change? What will be the negative consequences of this change? Why was this change made?

**Answer:**
Forecast, to me, suggests weather forecasting, so we are trying our best guest given the circumstances and what is known, so we are trying to predict what will happen, but that is what it is, just a prediction, and these can vary. As a positive result, I understand that when forecasting we might dedicate more to discussing what we know, what we can do, and by doing so, we might suffer from a less stressful word for everyone and try our best.

For the negative consequences, it can be that some people may be too relaxed and take it too lightly, so it is important that the Scrum Master teaches Scrum values and principles and what are their meanings properly to everyone working with Scrum.

This change was made because the word commitment used to be taken as a guarantee, but that is impossible in the complex domain and complex type of work like software development, and in many situations, that harms a team from some type of command-and-control approach, where punishments might happen like having to work overtime because of the "commitment".

### The Daily Scrum is an event that happens every day. What would be the consequences if it were held every third day?

**Answer:**
When the Daily Scrum does not happen every day, it might endanger transparency, since the opportunities to inspect and adapt the Sprint Backlog it is reduced or lowered. It can lead to slow making decisions on what to do next, impediments are raised and resolved more slowly, communication between Developers could suffer, and unnecessary meetings might be created that might hinders their focus and it could be prevented by having a Daily every day.

###
What artifacts are part of Scrum, and during which Scrum Events are they likely to be the subject of inspection?

**Answer:**
The Sprint Backlog is inspected during Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, and Sprint Review.
- The Product Backlog is inspected during Sprint Planning and Sprint Review.
- The Product Increment is inspected during Sprint Planning and Sprint Review.

Each Scrum artifact now posses a commitment, introduced in the Scrum Guide 2020 version as:
- For the Product Backlog, it is the Product Goal.
- For the Sprint Backlog, it is the Sprint Goal.
- For the Increment, it is the Definition of Done.

Apart from that: all artifacts may be inspected at any time, and be the subject of conversation at any time. Scrum prescribes frequent inspection, as long as it doesn't hinder the work being done.
Backlog Management and Backlog Refinement inspect the Product Backlog but is not a Scrum event in the strict sense.

### The developers in your Scrum Team raise an impediment. The work planned for the upcoming Sprint involves certain knowledge and expertise they do not possess within the team. How do you handle this impediment?

**Answer:**
An impediment is something the team might not be able to resolve in case they don't possess the ability or knowledge for it. The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, and coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality is an essential part of its accountabilities.

However, when an impediment cannot be addressed by the team, the Scrum Master must act and help remove the impediments.
The Scrum Master might ask if the expertise really needed? A conversation with the Product Owner could help, finding that another approach / changing scope is also viable. Perhaps a third-party can supply the code or service needed.

If the expertise really is needed, start by asking the team how they as a cross-functional team could gain the knowledge needed. Maybe time to learn, do research, training, or building a prototype could be enough. During sprint planning, outside experts may be consulted by the team. If none of this resolves the impediment, the Scrum Master can help the team getting the needed expertise from inside or outside the organisation available to them.

### How does the Cone of Uncertainty influence the work being done by a Scrum Team during a product's development lifetime?

**Answer:**
At the beginning of the Product's lifetime, many unknowns may exist. The team will work on removing these unknowns. For example by doing research, prototyping, testing with users. When important unknowns are uncovered, work can gradually include more functional stories adding valuable features. At the end of a product's development lifetime, work, in general, may decrease. The Unrealised Value is low, and the Current Value is high. Work will become more operational in nature. The Evidence-Based Management Guide can support and enhance how a product can deliver value to its customers by exploring the Key-Value Areas.

### In what ways does the Scrum Master attend the Sprint Retrospective?

**Answer:**
Oftentimes the Scrum Master may facilitate the Sprint Retrospective based on Scrum Team request. More importantly, the Scrum Master joins the Sprint Retrospective as a Scrum Team member, inspecting people, processes, and tools, while helping the Scrum Team identifies and improve on the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness.

### The Product Owner is a part of the Scrum Team. How can you, as the Scrum Master, determine if the Product Owner is interacting with the Developers of the Scrum Team enough?

**Answer:**
First and foremost, it is important to define what "enough" means for yourself and for your Scrum Team. Engage in constant conversation with the team members and Product Owner individually, as well as in a group to gauge.

Observe if the Product Owner and the Developers collaborate throughout the Sprint, not only during Planning, Review, and Retrospectives in order to discuss and decide on the work's being performed, addressing issues, and making decisions accordingly. In case that is not the case, the Scrum Master teaches and coaches the Product Owner on improving her interactions with the Developers, discussing the impact of these low interactions can cause and harm.

Use the Sprint Reviews to check if the Product Owner can inspect the result of the Sprint produced by the Scrum Team, in case there are surprises, it might be an opportunity to improve their interactions in the next Sprint.

### Mid-sprint a development team forecasts it will not be able to deliver all the planned backlog items. They are worried and ask for your advice as Scrum Master. What will you tell them?

**Answer:**
In Scrum, the Scrum Team does not commit to delivering all sprint backlog items. Work being discovered during the Sprint is expected. Commitment is made to do the very best to reach the sprint goal and with the highest quality possible. If the impact is deemed minor and the sprint goal is still within reach, the Scrum Team can continue work. If the impact is bigger, the developers of the Scrum Team should discuss if and how they can still reach the sprint goal. Having the Product Owner join this conversation would be highly advisable, as it improves transparency and enables faster decision making.

### What is Scrum's relation to Empiricism / Empirical Process Control?

**Answer:**
Scrum is built on empiricism. Decisions are made on information gained before, known as a closed feedback loop. The three pillars of Empirical Process Control are Transparency, Inspection, and Adaptation. Scrum Events allow us to uphold transparency and help us ask where are we, do an inspection so we ask how are we doing, and enable adaptation so we check this information and ask, do we need to change?.
Scrum Guide states the following "The Sprint is a container for all other events. Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required. Failure to operate any events as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt. Events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimise the need for meetings not defined in Scrum." So it is important to understand that each event in Scrum contributes and enables the pillars of empiricism to work.

### People have different skill sets, personalities, attitudes, and abilities to work in teams. A project is going to use a group of 100 people. As the Scrum Master - How would you devise who would be on which teams?

**Answer:**
As a Scrum Master, I would facilitate a workshop, having a Product Owner share the product vision, product goals, its market, Product's users, and stakeholders, and set some boundaries that are helpful like what is the team size we could have, what skills are needed in each team for the Product, create an environment where people can self-organise  and self-manage to form teams.

It is also important to share with these people that the aim of providing as much value as possible is the
the ultimate goal, and to find out what value is, the customer needs to be asked and ask what their priority and needs are.

### The Developers select a set of Product Backlog items for a Sprint Backlog, with the intent to get the selected items "Done" by the end of the Sprint. What does this mean? What does "Done" refer to? What work should the Developers of the Scrum Team do to the Product Backlog items so that they are "done" and transparent to the Product Owner at the end of the Sprint?

**Answer:**
Done refers to completing the task to a specific level of detail for the team's and customer's needs. Developers should create tasks with acceptance criteria that meet the Definition of Done that includes all work necessary to create a potentially usable increment and also it was agreed with the Product Owner. This can be explicitly mentioned in the Product Backlog Item.

### Explain the difference between "Mechanical" Scrum and "Professional" Scrum.

**Answer:**
In Mechanical Scrum, a Scrum team and its organisation have implemented Scrum by the book, they do all the events, have assigned all the roles, and might be able to deliver a working increment every Sprint. However, they don't really strive to pursue opportunities to inspect and adapt, and how to get better in the next Sprint, they just do Scrum.

A Professional Scrum can be seen as an adaptation of Scrum that, might have started out as a Mechanical Scrum and has led the team and organisation to discover the values and principles of Scrum and thereby to continuously improve their Product and process to better and quicker serve their users and customers, and to a more joyous and innovative workspace. In this approach, the Scrum team really lives the values, and it is reflected in their behaviour and attitudes, and they look for opportunities to inspect and adapt in order to deliver more value.

In mechanical Scrum, the team and organisation go through the motions of Scrum but don't utilise the transparency Scrum provides for their own work and context to improve it by addressing the most important issues. This aspect of Scrum can be hard, and it takes courage, perseverance, and discipline that not all teams and organisations have.

### Scrum Team consists of people. People often have different opinions about how things should be done. They sometimes are emotional without an obvious cause. If a Scrum team gets caught in a conflict, its productivity will suffer. What role does the Scrum Master play in this situation? What techniques should the Scrum Master employ? If the team stays in conflict, regardless, what should the Scrum Master do?

**Answer:**
"If a Scrum team gets caught in a conflict, its productivity will suffer." I disagree with the statement; I believe conflict is essential in team growth if expressed in a solutions-oriented manner with team members keeping an open mind, and remain respectful.

It is important that the Scrum Master before acts, observe the Scrum Team's abilities to solve their own conflict, so he doesn't prevent opportunities for the team to be self-managing. In case the team is not able to solve it, then the Scrum Master approaches this situation as a facilitator, without taking sides, keeping the Scrum values at heart, remaining neutral, learns what is the conflict about, phrasing open-ended questions, where people have the courage to share their thoughts, respecting the different opinions, and organise them in a way everyone has a chance to share. Valuable techniques to be employed in this situation are for the Scrum Master to mirror what the team is saying and how they're feeling, guiding them to stay focused on what is productive and remove what is harmful. Facilitating the discussion in a more analytical way, visualising it, add structure, e.g. create a pros-cons table for each opinion, fish-bone diagram for root causes, liberating structures like what? so what? now what? etc.

Working as a Scrum Team to find solutions that help them solve the conflicts, and becoming even more self-managed, perhaps using the Sprint Retrospective to address it all together.

However, sometimes people care so much about issues they cannot back down or things can get in a way that is not productive or positive for a team anymore, If the Scrum Master has done everything he can, facilitate, mediate, coach, general persuasion, breakout sessions, coffee breaks, and actively listening and working with the people on these conflicts, but it still remains, for the sake of the team effort, perhaps working with other Scrum Masters or the organisation to get suggesting in how to help the team or even suggesting the prime cause of conflict is moved to a different team.

### You have been appointed the Scrum Master for a brand new product your organisation is planning to develop. A Product Owner has also been appointed. Initially, nineteen developers will work on the Product. What approaches are common for forming teams for this Product, and how do they likely benefit or hinder the Product Development effort?

**Answer:**
Facilitate the teams in forming teams themselves.
- Benefit: Teams feel empowered and gain ownership. Knowledge of the group is used.
- Hinder: Can be a messy process, teams may lack the experience to do this effectively.

Form two or three cross-functional teams.
- Benefit: Cross-functionality helps teams to deliver working software. All knowledge and skills in the team.
- Hinder: A team may not know what skills are needed for the new Product, developers with expertise might lose touch with similar experts in other teams.

Form teams according to specialisation. A frontend team and a back-end team for example.
- Benefit: Experts can quickly learn from each other.
- Hinder: It will be harder to deliver working, integrated software that includes the work done by both teams. Not how Scrum describes teams, but nonetheless a possible strategy.

### A team has been practicing Scrum for over 6 months. As a Scrum Master, what would you look for that would quantifiably demonstrate that the Scrum Team has matured?

**Answer:**
Over the 6 months, the Scrum Team is able to achieve their Sprint Goals, delivering done increments and validating them with the users/stakeholders when inspecting them in the Sprint Reviews. The Scrum Values is understood and lived by the team members, they communicate and collaborate with each other, work together, and try their best to solve their impediments whenever possible.

The Definition of Done has become more stringent over time, and that is reflected in the product increments and their quality increased.
Improvements are more natural, and the Scrum Team uses the Sprint Retrospective to inspect and adapt opportunities to improve themselves, their processes, tools, etc.
The Scrum Team has its members selecting their work items from the Product Backlog as a self-managing team.

### One of the Scrum events is the Daily Scrum. What is the purpose of the Daily Scrum? What should the outcome be?

**Answer:**
As the Scrum Guide states, "the purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work."

Since the Daily is designed to reduce complexity and it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint, it provides an opportunity for the Developers to inspect and adapt according to what they learn while working on the items from the Sprint Backlog, and by doing so, it helps them raise impediments, making decisions on what to do next and as a result, it provides transparency.

As an outcome of the Daily, the Developers increases their focus, providing a more up-to-date Sprint Backlog and a better understanding of its progress towards completing the work in the Sprint Backlog.

### What would be an example of a Scrum team member displaying unethical behaviour?

**Answer:**
Some broadly defined examples: knowingly creating low-quality products;
withholding important information; not helping team members; working in a way that damages the team, stakeholders, or end-users; not respecting others' opinions; going against agreements made.

Knowing the Scrum values but ignoring or not living them. Producing product increments that are not compliant with the definition of done or ignoring it. Working on items or task that comes from outside the Product Backlog and hide it from the Scrum Team.

### Technical debt is the sole concern of the development team. As a Scrum Master, do you agree with this statement? Why or why not?

**Answer:**
Do not agree. Technical debt influences the agility, delivery, and quality of the Product. The more technical debt is created, the harder it becomes to add to the Product, eventually slowing down development to a near halt. This makes it everyone's concern. When you're no longer able to deliver working software, the whole of the organisation and its customers suffer.

The developers of the Scrum team is the one responsible for knowing when technical debt occurs. However, it's everyone's concern to keep the debt within acceptable limits by addressing it during sprints. For the Product Owner and stakeholders, this means not all work in a sprint will add new functionality to the Product.

Technical debt harms transparency, it is dangerous for a software product development if not addressed properly since it leads to assumptions that can impact the quality and progress of the Product.

### As the Scrum Master for three Scrum Teams working on the same project. There is one Product Backlog that all three teams must select from. There is one codebase. All three Scrum Teams come to you because they are anticipating a problem in the upcoming two Sprints. Each Scrum Team needs full-time support from an external person, Mary. Mary is the only DBA with check-in/checkout permission for the database subschema they will be changing. The Scrum Team claim that they can't proceed into these Sprints without Mary, full time, on their team. What do you do?

**Answer:**
The Scrum Master can suggest that the Scrum Team collaborates with the Product Owner to re-order the Product Backlog items in a way that Mary can serve one team full-time in a Sprint while other teams work on items that do not require Mary immediately.

It can be also an opportunity for the Developers from the Development Teams with an interest in Mary's domain that could volunteer to take on this work in their respective teams, so they are exercising self-management and also improving their skills, becoming even more cross-functional.

As the Scrum Master serves the organisation by leading, training, and coaching the organisation in its Scrum adoption; Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organisation according to the Scrum guide, I can also help the organisation on aiming to change this structure where they have only Mary as DBA with checking/checkout permission and share these skills and permissions with others, guiding this organisation on improving the cross-functionality of its teams.

### As part of the Product Backlog Management, your team's Product Owner wants to create a Sprint Backlog for the upcoming Sprint. This way it's ready during Sprint Planning making the event more effective. What's your opinion on this?

**Answer:**
Even this looks well-meant, this conflicts with the Scrum Guide. The Sprint Backlog is created during Sprint Planning as the Scrum Guide states, "Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team."

Additional considerations:

1. The Product Owner focuses on asking: Why is this Sprint valuable? and he proposes work that could increase the value in the Sprint

2. The Product Owner and Developers work together and collaborate to answer the ###  What can be done this Sprint?

3. The Developers plan the necessary work that will meet the Definition of Done and will produce an Increment by answering this ###  How will the chosen work get done?

4. Furthermore, the Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective will likely influence the Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog.

5. By preparing it beforehand, transparency is reduced. By making the plan for the Sprint together, essential conversations take place.

#### Someone from the HR department approaches you. They regret to inform you that the Product Owner for your team is absent starting today and will be unavailable for the rest of this Sprint. The Product Owner might be back at work somewhere during the next Sprint, but it's all unknown at this point. What should the Scrum team do?

**Answer:**
For the short term, this Sprint and the next, the Scrum Team should be able to continue and work, adhering to the product vision the Product Owner layed out and its expressed in the order of the Product Backlog. The latest state and ordering of the Product Backlog should reflect this vision.

The Scrum events must continue and take place, in case the stakeholders are not invited for the upcoming Sprint Review, the Scrum Master should work on that. If the Product Owner's absence lengthens, this becomes an impediment to the team. The Scrum Master must make this known to the organisation and a new Product Owner should be appointed.

### What are the characteristics of a high performing team?

**Answer:**
Beyond quality and ability to release. Integrity coupled with leadership team, mastery, sharpen each other. Wanting to continuously stay curious, be open to the idea that we might be wrong about something. Wanting to read and learn- a habit I have grown into as a result of trying to keep up with all the smart people I have had the privilege of working with.

### How does a Scrum Master work with management?

**Answer:**
Scrum Master often has more success when they partner with leadership and management. Expectations around what can be accomplished in a single conversation.

Learning what they need / helping them to adopt Scrum. Typically control or at least influence boundaries for Scrum Teams, for example, budget, team formation, etc. What do management need?
